# ML-Basis

In this repository are stored Jupyter notebooks dealing with basics of Machine learning (Statistical Learning): 
Preprocessing, 
Exploratory Data Analysis,
Feature Selection,
Model Selection,
Classification,
Regression,
Dimensionality Reduction, 
Clustering,
Pipeline.


By the way, the focus is mainly on supervised learning tasks namely, regression and classification. 
As a matter of fact, many of the notebooks resamble the R markdown files in my other repository `Statistical_Learning_Intro`. However, that R markdowns go more in depth and require more theoretical knowledge in order to be properly understood

NB: Due to some import error and other issues related to libraries' download I suggest to run the notebooks on Colab.
